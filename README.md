# CyberPlayer_DQN
This repository contains the code to make the cyber player playing the mirror game in a group scenario. 
The group's members are simulated by different virtual trainers. Each virtual trainer is driven by an optimal control algorithm 
and has a markov chain model embedded in its core to mimic the kinematic features of a human player.

multi-agent joint motor task", submitted to Frontiers in Robotics and AI, 2021.
